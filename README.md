# BuffWatch

This is an addon for Final Fantasy XI's Windower 4. It tells you when specified buffs are down.

## Features

- Profile-based, so you can easily swap out which buffs you care about based on job/content/etc.
- Buffs can be aliased to whatever you want. For example, you can track "Cocoon" instead of its actual text "Defense Boost"
- Profiles named after a job abbreviation (i.e. pld) will be swapped to automatically when you change to that job, and reset when you change to something else (can disable this through settings)
- Decent amount of config options for visuals and behavior.
- Easy to reposition. Drag it wherever and the position is saved.
- `search` command for looking up buff ids
- `debug` command to show currently active buffs (with ids)
